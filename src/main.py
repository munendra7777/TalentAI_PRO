###### Why I Built this App? 

Hiring can be overwhelmingâ€”time-consuming, expensive, and full of manual effort. I wanted to make it easier by **automating pre-screening** and helping recruiters quickly identify the right candidates.  

At the same time, I wanted to support **candidates** by providing resume insights, interview preparation, and better visibility into their fit for a role. While AI-led interviews are a future goal, TalentAI Pro is here to **simplify hiring and empower both recruiters and job seekers today**.
